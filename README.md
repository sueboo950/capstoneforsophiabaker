# About
I was born in the parish of Kingston, Jamaica. I was the 9th of 16 siblings. I grew up in a small community called Cassava Piece where I was a young role model to others. At the age of 12, I formed a youth club for the younger children in and around the community. A lot of people, even older adults were motivated by my work ethic. I would feed the kids in the community, give them shelter if they needed a place to stay and also speak with them if they needed someone to talk to.

My education journey started at the SwallowField Primary School then on to Gaynstead High School after which I migrated to the United States of America where I furthered my studies at the Daytona State College and Delgado Community College. I achieved an associate degree also during my time of studies, I received both the merit and the shining star awards.

I am an Evangelist, a wife, and a mother of 3 children and an adopted child, while being a humanitarian and philanthropist. I am always calm under pressure and could handle anything that was thrown at me. I am greatly respected in my community mainly because of my willing heart and wanting to share not only my time, but sharing the Word of God.

My favorite scripture in the bible is Proverbs 11 verse 30 “The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise”.

I strive to live by winning souls for the lord…..

Me and my husband Roderic Baker founded and started A Non Profit organization and foundation called Roderic and Sophia Bakers foundations where we assist people who are in need of clothing, food items and assistance in school fees and other basic necessities. We also go out and feed the hungry and the homeless. I also run my own business; Sophia Bakers Private Care where I employ Nurses, CNAs, and HHAs.
